The reason is simple. The stud will go through you ear lobe and many women are especially sensitive, in some cases even to gold. Titanium is not only as strong as some steels even if it&#39;s less dense, but it&#39;s completely hypoallergenic and for this reason it&#39;s used in medical prostheses and orthopedic implants.\nThe pad and the small butterfly back are surgical steel.\n\nThese earrings are perfect for any occasion, ideal for every day use or a gift for her.\n\n\nThey are packaged in a special folder and shipped in a cute box also created by me.\n\nQuestions ?.

Glow In The Dark powder (Pro GLOW) photoluminescent pigment is a new type of environment friendly Alkaline earth aluminate pigment with the characters of non-toxic, innocuous, non-radioactive. By absorbing ultraviolet light and other visible light, it can release the energy in the form of visible light for hours in the dark and features duty-cycle operation.\nThe pendant needs light to charge. Direct sunlight or a strong light lamp is perfect, but the best is UV light. The stronger the light is and the longer it’s left under the better and longer-lasting the glow will be. The pendant will glow in evening conditions fading out over the first hour but still containing enough energy to glow in the dark for hours.\n \nSize\n\n- Pendant  (Blank size:  apx 25mm x 35mm)",

The solder on the fall leaf sun catcher was treated with black patina and with copper patina, to achieve a deep bronze hue, perfect for Autumn. The Autumn stained glass leaf was then waxed and buffed to a brilliant shine and to protect from oxidation.\n\n&quot;Jodeliece Bradstreet&quot; original hand-drawn stained glass design.",

Agate also promotes marital fidelity.\n\nAgate is useful as a protection amulet when traveling, and is especially effective against traffic accidents. \n\nAs a professional support stone, Agate stabilizes the imagination and inspiration of artists, provides personal security for police, telephone workers, cooks, chefs and bakers, and protection from falling objects for builders and construction workers. It provides physical strength and endurance for dancers, dentists, and environmentalists, and emotional endurance for educators and recreational workers.\n\nSource: internet",
