But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

      "title": "Bubinga -  Wooden Guitar Pick - Wood Guitar Pick - Wood Plectrum - Exotic Wood - Wood Gift",
      "description": "!!!!!!CUSTOM ENGRAVING!!!!!! THIS WOOD TYPE IS CUSTOMIZABLE FOR ONLY $3.50 PER SIDE. \n\nCLICK THE LINK BELOW FOR CUSTOMIZING OPTIONS. YOU CAN FIND THIS WOOD TYPE ON THIS LINK UNDER THE “WOOD TYPE OPTION ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/100384851/one-custom-engraved-wooden-guitar-pick?ref=shop_home_active_1\n\nThis wooden guitar pick is made out of Bubinga (This wood comes from Africa)\n\nBubinga has a beautiful color, and has the perfect density to be a sturdy guitar pick.  \n\nIt is sanded down to a very smooth finish to show off its great color. At the top of the pick there are finger grips to keep the pick from slipping while strumming. \n\nMakes for the perfect gift for any music lover or guitar player. \n\nDifference between plastic and wood picks: \n&gt;Wood is much stiff and has little to no flexibility\n&gt; It offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n\nCommon Q&As:\n\nQ: How big are these picks? \n\nA: My guitar picks are approximately \n&gt;1 1/16 inch or 26 mm wide\n&gt;1 1/2 inch long or 31 mm\n&gt;1/8 of an inch thick or 3 mm thick to insure durability and to allow the grooves at the top of the pick to be deeper, allowing for better grip\n\nSome guitar picks may not be exactly those dimensions. But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. Can you actually play with these?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it.\n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern as shown in the 2nd picture\n\nPlease click the blue Contact button if you have any questions.\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",
