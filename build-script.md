# Build List TODOs:

1. Create a `dist/` folder or clean out the `dist/` folder, at least...
2. Copy pieces of `bower_components/` into `dist/` in a _new_ `dist/bower_components/`
3. Build the Sass into CSS; copy our built CSS into `dist/css/main.css`
4. Copy our `src/js/` into `dist/js/`
5. Copy our `index.html` into `dist/`; copy `partials/` into `dist/partials/`
6. Switch `$http` requests to use the _real_ API instead of our cached copy.
7. BONUS: Minify and concatenate all the JavaScript; update links in `index.html`
